# SAS727

SAS727 is a community resource exchange service built with Ruby on Rails. 

SAS727 relies on Aalto Social Interface (http://github.com/sizzlelab/asi) on its 
user management and few other things, so it can't be run alone.

For serious use you need to install your own ASI or get access to an existing one, 
but for testing you can use the default test account on OtaSizzle's test server.

See github wiki for the original Kassi project for installation instructions: http://wiki.github.com/sizzlelab/Kassi/
